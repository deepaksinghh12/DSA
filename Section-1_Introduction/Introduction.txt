Introduction

What is Data Structure ?
    - Data Structures are different ways of organizing data on your computer, that can be used efficiently.


What is an Algorithm ?
    - Set of Instructions to perform a Task.


What makes a good algorithms?
    - Correctness
    - Efficiency


Types of Data Structures ?
    - Primitive :
        • Integer
        • Float
        • Character
        • Boolean
    
    - Non-Primitive :
        -> Linear :
            ▪ Static :
                • Array
            ▪ Dynamic :
                • Linked List
                • Stack
                • Queue
        
        -> Non-Linear :
            • Tree
            • Graph
