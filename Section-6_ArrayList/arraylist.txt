ðŸ§  What is an ArrayList?
        ArrayList is a resizable array implementation in Java.

        Part of the java.util package.

        Unlike arrays, ArrayList can grow and shrink in size dynamically.

        It stores elements in order and allows duplicates.


import java.utils.ArrayList;
import java.utils.Arrays;

ArrayList<Type> arrayListName = new ArrayList<Type>()

ArrayList arrayListName = new ArrayList()

Time complexity-O(1)
Space complexity-O(N)

-We cannot add an element in our array if the given array is short than that of our index at which we want to insert it.

-What Does "Amortized O(1)" Mean?
Normal O(1) means constant time for every operation.

Amortized O(1) means:

Most add() operations at the end take constant time.

Occasionally, when the internal array is full, it must be copied to a bigger array, which takes O(n) time.

But since resizing happens infrequently, the average cost per add() is still O(1) over many operations.

So, add() in ArrayList is amortized O(1).

Example-

ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<>();

names.add("Alice");
names.add("Bob");
names.add("Charlie");

System.out.println(names.get(1));  // Output: Bob
names.remove("Alice");
System.out.println(names);         // Output: [Bob, Charlie]
